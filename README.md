# Text_Summarizion_tool-Using-LangChain-
Developed a robust text summarization tool leveraging LangChain, implemented in a Google Colab environment. This project automates the process of summarizing lengthy texts into concise, informative summaries, providing an efficient solution for managing large volumes of information



Text Summarization with LangChain and Google Colab
Introduction
-------------
Welcome to the Text Summarization project! This project utilizes LangChain and Google Colab to efficiently summarize large bodies of text into concise and informative summaries. Text summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), making it easier to digest and understand large volumes of information quickly
Researchers , Engineers and Professors can use this tool as an effective measure to summarize research papers, documentaries and so on

Project Overview
This project aims to simplify the process of summarizing text documents. Leveraging the power of LangChain, we create summaries that capture the essential information from input text. The project is designed to run on Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to use without the need for extensive local setup.
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Panchadip-128/Text_Summarizion_tool-Using-LangChain-
2.	Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd text-summarization-langchain

3.	Open the Colab Notebook:
o	Go to Google Colab.
o	Upload the ArticleSummarizer_LangChain.ipynb file 

5.	Install Dependencies:
The Colab notebook includes cells to install the necessary libraries. Run these cells to set up your environment:
python

!pip install langchain
!pip install transformers

Usage
1.	Upload Text Files:
Use the Colab interface to upload the text files you want to summarize.
2.	Run the Summarization:
Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the text and generate summaries. You can customize the summarization parameters such as length and style.

4.	View and Download Summaries:
The summarized text will be displayed in the notebook. You can also download the summaries for further use.
Examples
Example 1: Summarizing an Article

* from langchain import LangChain *

# Initialize LangChain with the default model
summarizer = LangChain()

# Example text
text = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries with its ability to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. 
AI systems can identify patterns, make predictions, and provide insights that were previously impossible or impractical.
"""

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
print(summary)
Example 2: Customizing Summary Length

summary = summarizer.summarize(text, max_length=50)
print(summary)
